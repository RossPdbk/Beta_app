            <li>The Data Processing Unit (ALU & AC) and the Control Unit of a computer system are jointly known as the central processing unit.
            </li>
            <li>The design of CPU is based on Von Neumann architecture which is proposed by Sir John Von Neumann and the computer is known as IAS computer.</li>
            <li>The IAS computer consists of registers and the set of instructions are used to perform different operations. </li>
            <li>The basic structure of CPU is as follows: </li>
        </ol>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Arithmetic Logic unit (ALU) :</b> The actual processing of the data and instruction are performed by Arithmetic Logical Unit.
                <br>It performs arithmetic and logical operations such as multiplication, division, subtraction, addition ,etc.
                <br>Data is transferred to ALU from storage unit when required. After processing the output is returned back to storage unit for further processing or getting stored. </li>
            <li> <b>Control Unit :</b> Control Unit is responsible  for  co-ordinating various operations using time signal.
                <br>The control unit determines the sequence in which computer programs and instructions are executed.
                <br> It also acts as a switch board operator when several users access the computer simultaneously.</li>
    <p><u>CPU consists of following registers :</u></p>
            <li><b>Accumulator (AC) :</b> It interacts with ALU and stores input or output result.</li>
            <li><b>Program Counter (pc) :</b>It contains the address of the next instruction to be executed. </li>
            <li><b>Instruction Register (IR) :</b>It holds the current Instruction.</li>
            <li><b>Data Register (DR) :</b>It act as a buffer storage between main memory and CPU </li>
             <li><b>Memory Address Register (MAR) :</b> It provides address of memory location which indicates the where the data is present. </li>
        </ul>
