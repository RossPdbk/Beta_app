	<h4>Write short note on Inetrleaved Memory.</h4>
	<p>
	<ol>
	<li>Interleaved memory is a design made to compensate for the relatively slow speed of dynamic 
	random-access memory (DRAM) or core memory, by spreading memory addresses evenly across memory banks. 
		</li>
	<li>For example: If we have 4 memory banks(4-way Interleaved memory), with each containing 256 bytes, then, the Block Oriented scheme(no interleaving), will assign virtual address 0 to 255 to the first bank, 256 to 511 to the second bank. But in Interleaved memory, 
	virtual address 0 will be with the first bank, 1 with the second memory bank,
	2 with the third bank and 3 with the fourt, and then 4 with the first memory bank again. </li>
	<li>Hence, CPU can access alternate sections immediately without waiting for memory to be cached. There are multiple memory banks which take turns for supply of data. </li>
	<li>An interleaved memory with n banks is said to be n-way interleaved. In an interleaved memory system, 
	there are still two banks of DRAM but logically the system seems one bank of memory that is twice as large. </li>
	<li>In the interleaved bank representation below with 2 memory banks, the first long word of bank 0 is floowed by that of bank 1, which is followed by the second long word of bank 0,
	which is followed by the second long word of bank 1 and so on.</li>
	<li>The following figure shows the organization of two physical banks of n long words. 
	All even long words of logical bank are located in physical bank 0 and all odd long words are located in physical bank 1.</li>
