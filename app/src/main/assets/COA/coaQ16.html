	<h4>Explain Segmentation.</h4>
	<p>
	<ul>
	<li>Memory segmentation is the division of a computer's primary memory into segments or sections.</li>
	<li>A table stores the information about all such segments and is called Segment Table. </li>
	<li><b>Segment Table:</b> It maps two dimensional Logical address into one dimensional Physical address.It's each table entry has Base Address and Limit</li>
	<li><b>Base Address:</b>It contains the starting physical address where the segments reside in memory.</li>
	<li><b>Limit:</b>It specifies the length of the segment.</li>
	<li>Address generated by the CPU is divided into: <br>
				Segment number (s): Number of bits required to represent the segment.<br>
				Segment offset (d): Number of bits required to represent the size of the segment.</li>
	<li><b>Advantages of Segmentation:</b><br>
				No Internal fragmentation.<br>
				Segment Table consumes less space in comparison to Page table in paging.</li>	
	<li><b>Disadvantage of Segmentation:</b><br>
As processes are loaded and removed from the memory, the free memory space is broken into little pieces, causing External fragmentation.</li>
	
	</ul>
