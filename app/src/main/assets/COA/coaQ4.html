<h4> Show IEEE 754 standards for Binary Floating Point Representation for 32 bit single format and 64 bit double format. </h4>
<p>The standards for representing floating point numbers in 32-bits and 64-bits have been developed by
 the institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), referred to as IEEE 754 standards.
<br><b>1.Floating Point Representation:</b><br>
IEEE floating point representation for binary real numbers consists
of three parts.<br>
<img src="floating1.JPG"/><br><br>
	1. Sign, for which 1 bit is allocated. 0 represents a positive number and 1 for negative number.<br>
	2. Exponent is allocated 8 bits. <br>
	3. Mantissa (called significand in the standard) is allocated 23 bits.<br>As both positive and negative
	numbers are required for the exponent, instead of using a separate sign bit for the exponent, the standard uses a biased
	representation. The value of the bias 127.<br><br>

	<b>2. Double Precision Floating Point Representation:</b><br>
	The IEEE 754 floating point standard for 64-bit (called doubleprecision) numbers is very similar to the 32-bit standard.The
	main difference is the allocation bits for the exponent and the significand.

	2. Exponent is allocated 11 bits.<br>
	3. Mantissa (called significand in the standard) is allocated 52 bits.<br>
	The value of the bias 1023
