    <ul>
        <li>Amdahl's law is a formula which gives the theoretical speedup by running part of it in parallel.
        </li>
    <li><b>Speedup:</b></li>
       <ul> <li>The speed of a program is the time it takes the program to excecute. </li>
       <li> This could be measured in any increment of time. </li>
       <li> Speedup is defined as the time it takes a program to execute in serial (with one processor) divided by the time it takes to execute in parallel (with many processors).</li>
       </ul>
        <li>A program (or algorithm) which can be parallelized can be split up into two parts:</li>
    <ol>
        <li>A part which cannot be parallelized</li>
        <li>A part which can be parallelized</li>
    </ol>
        <li>
            Amdahlâ€™s law states that in parallelization, if P is the proportion of a system or program that can be made parallel,
            and 1-P is the proportion that remains serial, then the maximum speedup is 1/((1-P)+(P/S)). </li>
    <li>Amdahl's law can be formulated the following way:<br>S<small>latency</small>(s): 1/((1-P)+(P/S))

    </li>
    <li>where<br>

        S latency is the theoretical speedup of the execution of the whole task;<br>

        s is the speedup of the part of the task that benefits from improved system resources;<br>

        p is the proportion of execution time that the part benefiting from improved resources originally occupied.</li>
    <li>If N tends to infinity then the maximum speedup tends to 1/(1-P). </li>
    </ul>
