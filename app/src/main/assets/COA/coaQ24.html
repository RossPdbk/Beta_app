        <li>An instruction cycle is the basic operational process of a computer. </li>
        <li>It is also called as fetch–decode–execute cycle.</li>
        <li>A program consists of set of instructions which are performed by the processor. </li>
        <li>To process an instruction processor performs: </li>
        <ol>
            <li>The processor fetches an instruction. </li>
            <li>The processor decodes an instruction. </li>
            <li>The processor executes an instruction. </li>
        </ol>
    </ul>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Instruction Fetch cycle :</b> In this cycle, an instruction is fetched i.e read from memory location whose address is stored in PC.
                <br>This instruction is placed in the Instruction register(IR).
            </li>
            <li><b>Instruction Decode cycle :</b> In this cycle, the opcode of an instruction is decoded to determine which operation is to be performed.
            </li>
            <li><b>Instruction Execution cycle :</b> In this cycle, the specific operation is performed by the processor.This often involves performing arithmetic and logical operations & storing the result in destination location.
                <br>During execution of current instruction PC counter gets incremented and next instruction is fetched in fetch cycle.
            </li>
        </ul>
