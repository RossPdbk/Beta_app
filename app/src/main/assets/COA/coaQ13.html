	<li>Associative memory is also a set of storage locations, but they work a little differently. 
	Instead of looking up a storage location by its address, it looks up a storage location by its contents. 
	 </li>
	<li>So if you wanted to send that same package or letter to your neighbor, you would send it to the house where your neighbor is actually located, and it would get stored there.</li>
	<li>For example, that serves as an identifying tag. Associative memory is used in multilevel memory systems, 
	in which a small fast memory such as a cache may hold copies of some blocks of a larger memory for rapid access. </li>
	<li>To retrieve a word from associative memory, a search key (or descriptor) must be presented that represents particular values of all or some of the bits of the word. 
	This key is compared in parallel with the corresponding lock or tag bits of all stored words, and all words matching this key are signaled to be available.</li>
	<li>It seems to me that AssociativeMemory is more about the interface you use to access the memory store, than it is about the memory itself.</li>
	<li>Associative memory is expensive to implement as integrated circuitry.</li>
