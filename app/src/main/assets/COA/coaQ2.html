	<ol>
	<li>A Peripheral Component Interconnect Bus (PCI bus) connects the CPU and expansion boards such as modem cards, network cards and sound cards. 
	 </li>
	<li>These expansion boards are normally plugged into expansion slots on the motherboard.</li>
	<li>The PCI local bus is the general standard for a PC expansion bus, having replaced the Video 
	Electronics Standards Association (VESA) local bus and the Industry Standard Architecture (ISA) bus. 
	PCI has largely been replaced by USB. </li>
	<li>Most often, a PCI slot was used to connect sound and network cards. 
	</li>
	<li>PCI at one time was used to connect video cards, but graphics demand from gaming made it inadequate for that use.</li>
