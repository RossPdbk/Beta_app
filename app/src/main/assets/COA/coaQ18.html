	<h4>Explian flynn's classification.</h4>
    </div>
	<div class="card">
	<p> Flynn's classification for computer architectures is based on the number of <b>instruction steams</b> and <b>data streams</b> also called as Flynn's Taxonomy.<br>
		An instruction stream is a sequence of instruction while a data stream is a sequence of data which includes input data or temporary results.<br>
		They are classified into 4 types:
	<ul>
		<li>SISD (Single Instruction Single Data)</li>
		<li>SIMD (Single Instruction Multiple Data)</li>
		<li>MISD (Multiple Instruction Multiple Data)</li>
		<li>MIMD (Multiple Instruction Multiple Data)</li>
	</ul>
	<br>
		</div>
	<div class="card">
	<b> SISD (Single Instruction Single Data)</b>
		<ul>
		<li>A single-processor computer (Conventional computer) in which a single stream of instructions is fetched and executed using single data stream.</li>
		<li>It has no parallelism either in instructions or in data.</li>
		</ul>

		</div>
	<div class="card">
	<b> SIMD (Single Instruction Multiple Data)</b>
		<ul>
		<li>A single stream of instructions is fetched and executed using multiple data stream.</li>
		<li>So each processing unit can operate independently on a different data stream.</li>
		<li> This group is dedicated to array processing machines.</li>
		</ul>

		</div>
	<div class="card">
	<b>MISD (Multiple Instruction Multiple Data)</b>
		<ul>
		<li> In case of MISD computers, multiple processing units operate on one single-data stream .</li>
		<li>Few parallel computers fits into this class but in practice, this kind of organization has never been used.</li>
		</ul>

		</div>
	<div class="card">
	<b>MIMD (Multiple Instruction Multiple Data)</b>
		<ul>
		<li> Each processor has a separate program.</li>
		<li> An instruction stream is generated from each program.</li>
		<li> Each instruction operates on different data.</li>
		<li>Most parallel computers are based on MIMD architecture. There are two major categories</li>
		1)Shared memory multiprocessor.<br>
		2)Message passing multi-computers.
