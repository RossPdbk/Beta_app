	<li>A scanner is an input device that scans documents such as photographs and pages of text.
		</li>
	<li>When a document is scanned, it is converted into a digital format.  </li>
	<li>The two main types of scanners are <b>flatbed</b> and <b>portable</b> scanners. </li>
	<li>A flatbed scanner is the most common type of scanner, and it is designed to scan flat objects.</li>
	<li>A portable scanner is designed for travel purposes.</li>
	<li>Most flatbed scanners have a cover that lifts up so that books and other bulky objects can also be scanned. </li>
	<li>While sheet-fed scanner, which can only accept paper documents. </li>
	<li>Optical scanners capture the image of a usually flat object and transfer it to a computer, much like flatbed scanners.
	In order to produce a better quality image, as most people strive for in their printing, you need a higher resolution scanner.</li>
	<li>The resolution of a scanner is measured in dots per 12-inches, which makes sense because the more dots you have, the more color that shows up, producing higher quality scans.</li>
	<li>Scanners usually attach to your personal computer with a Small Computer System Interface ( SCSI ).</li>
