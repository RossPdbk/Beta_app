	<h4>Explain Hardwired Control unit.</h4>
	<p>
	<ol>
	<li>Hardwired control units are implemented through use of combinational logic units, 
	featuring a finite number of gates that can generate specific results based on the instructions that were used to invoke those responses.
	 </li>
	<li>Hardwired control units are generally faster than microprogrammed designs.</li>
	<li>Their design uses a fixed architecture—it requires changes in the wiring if the instruction set is modified or changed. </li>
	<li>This architecture is preferred in reduced instruction set computers (RISC) as they use a simpler instruction set. 
	</li>
	<li>Hard-wired control unit is implemented as sequential logic circuit or finite state machine ( FSM) generates controls s/g to execute the instruction.</li>
	<li>It operates at faster clock rate and in less clock cycle then a soft wired control unit.</li>

	<li><b>The advantages of hardwired control units are as follows:</b></li>
		<ul>
		<li>They operate at very high speeds making it crucial for real time and other applications where time is a major factor. 
		</li>
		<li>
		Hardwired control units don’t need separate control memory for storage of control word for generation of control signals.
		</li>
		<li>
		They perform the same task using logical circuitry which is also the reason they are so fast.</li>
		 <li>Hardwired control units are known to be more power efficient than their counterparts making them an ideal choice for processors in mobile devices.</li></ul>
