	<h4>Explain paging.</h4>
	<p>
	<ul>
	<li>Paging is a memory management scheme that eliminates the need for contiguous(continuous)allocation of physical memory. 
	This scheme permits the physical address space of a process to be non-contiguous.</li>
	<li>The Physical Address Space is conceptually divided into a number of fixed-size blocks, called frames. </li>
	<li>The Logical address Space is also splitted into fixed-size blocks, called pages.</li>
	<li>Page Size = Frame Size</li>
	<li>Address generated by CPU is divided into<br>
			<b>Page number(p):</b> Number of bits required to represent the pages in Logical Address Space or Page number<br>
			<b>Page offset(d): </b>Number of bits required to represent particular word in a page or page size of Logical Address Space or word number of a page or page offset.</li>
	<li>Physical Address is divided into<br>
			<b>Frame number(f):</b> Number of bits required to represent the frame of Physical Address Space or Frame number.<br>
			<b>Frame offset(d):</b> Number of bits required to represent particular word in a frame or frame size of Physical Address Space or word number of a frame or frame offset.</li>
	<li><b>Advantages :</b><br>
				reduces memory wastage.</li>	
	<li><b>Disadvantages:</b>
			<br>This approach slow down the memory access by faster of 2.
			<br>So the solution to this problem is to use special small fast cache know as translation Look Aside Buffer (TLB)</li>
