	  <p><h3>Q15.Prove that two succesive rotations are additive?</h3>
	  <p><h4> Ans:</h4><br>
	  Any sequence of transformations can be represented as a composite transformation matrix by calculating<br> 
	  the product of the individual transformation matrices. Forming products by transformation matrices is usually referred to<br>
	  as a concatenation, or composition, of matrices.<br>
	  
	 <b> Translations</b>

Two successive translations of an object can be carried out by first concatenating the translations matrices, then applying the <br>
composite matrix to the coordinate points. Specifying the two successive translation distances as (Tx1, Ty1) and (Tx2, Ty2), <br>
we calculate the composite matrix as<br>
	
	<table cellpadding="10">
	<tr><td>1, 0 ,0</td>
        <td>1, 0 ,0</td>	
		<td>1, 0 ,0</td>
    </tr>	
	<tr><td>0, 1 ,0 </td>
	<td>0 ,1 ,0 </td>
	<td>0 ,1 ,0 </td></tr>
	
	<tr><td>Tx1, Ty2 ,1</td>
	<td>Tx2, Ty2 ,1</td>
	<td>Tx1+Tx2, Ty1+Ty2 ,1</td></tr><table><br>
	Which demonstrates that two successive translations are additive.<br>
	
	<b>Scalings</b>

Concatenating transformation matrices for two successive scaling operations produces the following composite scaling matrix:<br>

S(Sx1, Sy1) . S(Sx2, Sy2) = S(Sx1.Sx2, Sy1.Sy2)<br>

The resulting matrix in this case indicates that successive scaling operations are multiplicative. That is, <br>
if we were to triple the size of an object twice in succession, the final size would be nine times that of the original.<br>

<b>Rotations<b>

The composite matrix for two successive rotations is calculated as<br>
R(&#920 1). R(&#920 2) = R(&#920 1 + &#920 2)<br>
As is the case with translations, successive rotations are additive.
