<li><u><b>Introduction:</b></u></li></ul>
OpenGL(Open Graphics Library) is a standard specification defining a cross language<br>
,cross platform API for writing applications that produce 2D and 3D computer graphics.<br>
  &nbsp OpenGL is a low level,procedural API, requiring the programmer to dictate the<br> exact steps required to render a scene.</div>

<ul type="circle"><li><u><b>OpenGL Operations:</b></u></li></ul>
The processing stages in basic OpenGL operation as follows:<br>
<ul type="square">
<li>&nbsp Display List:&nbsp Rather than having all commands proceed immediately,through the<br> pipeline,you can choose to accumulate  some of themin a list for processing later.</li><br>
<li>nbspEvaluater:&nbspthis stage of processing provides an efficient way to approximate curve and surface geometry</li><br>
<li>&nbspPrimitive Assembly:&nbspOpenGL processes geometric primitive points,line<br> segments and polygons all of which are described by vertices.Vertices are <br>transformed and lit, and primitives are clipped to the viewport in preparation for rasterizion.</li><br>
<li>&nbspRasterization:&nbspThis stage produces a series of frame buffer addresses and associated <br>values.Each fragment so priduced is fed into the last stage. </li><br>
<li>&nbspPre-fragment Operation:&nbspThese are final operation performed on the data<br> before it stored as pixels in the frame buffer.</li><br>
