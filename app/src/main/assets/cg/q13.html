	  <u><b>Gouraud Shading:</b></u>
<ol type="1">
<li>Gouraud surface shading was developed in the 1970s by Henri Gouraud.</li>
<li>It is the interpolation technique.</li>
<li>Intensity levels are calculated at each vertex and interpolated across the surface.</li>
<li>Intensity values for each polygon are matched with the values of adjacent polygons along the common edges.</li>
<li>This eliminates the intensity discontinuities that can occur in flat shading.</li>
<li>To render a polygon, Gouraud surface rendering proceeds as follows:</li>
<li>Determine the average unit normal vector at each vertex of the polygon.</li>
<li>Apply an illumination model at each polygon vertex to obtain the light intensity at that position.</li>
<li>Linearly interpolate the vertex intensities over the projected area of the polygon</li>
		   <li>Illumination values are linearly interpolated across each scan-line as shown in figure</li> </ol>

	  <ul type="circle">
	  <li>The intensities at point 4 can be interpolated from intensities 1 and 2.</li>
<li>Similarly, the intensities at point 5 can be interpolated from intensities 2 and 3.</li>
<li>Therefore the intensities of interaction points 4 and 5 are calculated from scan line.</li>
	   </ul> </div>
	   <div class="card">

<u>Advantages:</u>
<ol type="1">
<li> It removes the intensity discontinuity which exists in constant shading model.</li>
 <li>It can be combined with hidden surface algorithm to fill in the visible polygons along each scan line.</li></ol>
 
<u> Disadvantages:</u>
<ol type="1">
<li>Gouraud shading has a problem with specular reflections.</li>
<li> Gouraud shading can introduce anomalies known as Mach bands.</li>
	</ol> </div>

	   <div class="card">
 <u><b>Phong Shading:</b></u>
<ol type="1">
<li>A more accurate interpolation based approach for rendering a polygon was developed by Phong Bui Tuong.</li>

<li>Basically the Phong surface rendering model is also called as normal-vector interpolation rendering.</li>

<li>It interpolates normal vectors instead of intensity values.</li>

<li>To render a polygon, Phong surface rendering proceeds as follows:</li>

<li>Determine the average unit normal vector at each vertex of the polygon.</li>

<li>Linearly interpolate the vertex normal over the projected area of the polygon.</li>

<li>Apply an illumination model at positions along scan lines to calculate pixel intensities using the interpolated normal vectors as shown in figure</li></ol>

	   </div>
	   <div class="card">
	<u>Advantages:</u>
<ol type="1">
<li>It displays more realistic highlights on a surface.</li>

 <li>It greatly reduces the Mach band effect.</li>

<li> It gives more accurate results.</li></ol>

<u>Disadvantages:</u>
<ol type="1">
<li>It requires more calculations and greatly increases the cost of shading steeply.</li></ol>
