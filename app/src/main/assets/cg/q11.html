<li>Newspaper, photographs simulate a grey-scale image that can printed using only black ink.</li>

<li>A newspaper picture is, in fact, made up of a pattern of tiny black dots of varying size.</li>

<li>The human visual system has a tendency to average brightness over small areas, so the black dots and their white background merge and are perceived as an intermediate shade of grey.</li>

<li>The process of generating a binary pattern of black and white dots from an image is termed half toning.</li>

<li>In traditional newspaper and magazine production, this process is carried out photographically by projection of a transparency through a 'halftone screen' onto film.</li>

<li>The screen is a glass plate with a grid etched into it.</li>

<li>Different screens can be used to control the size and shape of the dots in the half toned image.</li>

<li>In computer graphics, half toning reproductions are approximated using rectangular pixel region say 2 x 2 pixels or 3 x 3 pixels.</li>

<li>These regions are called as “Halftone Patters” or “Pixel Patterns”.</li>

<li>2 x 2 pixel patterns for creating five intensity levels are shown in figure</li></ol>

<u><b>Dithering Technique</b></u><br>

<li>Another technique for digital half toning is dithering.</li>

<li>It is the technique for approximating halftones without reducing resolution, as pixel grid patterns do.</li>

<li>Dithering can be accomplished by Thresholding the image against a dither matrix.</li>

<li>To obtain n2 intensity levels, it is necessary to setup an n x n dither matrix Dn whose elements are distinct positive integers in the range of 0 to n2 – 1.</li>

<li>Matrix for 4 intensity level and 9 intensity level is shown below.</li></ol>

<ol type="1">
<li>The elements of a dither matrix are thresholds.</li>

<li>The matrix is laid like a tile over the entire image and each pixel value is compared with the corresponding threshold from the matrix.</li>

<li>The pixel becomes white if its value exceeds the threshold or black otherwise.</li>

<li>This approach produces an output image with the same dimensions as the input image, but with less detail visible.</li>

<li>High order dither matrices can be obtained from lower order matrices with the recurrence relation.</li></ol>
