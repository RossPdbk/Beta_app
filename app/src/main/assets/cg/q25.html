<div class="card">
   <u><b>Shearing:</b></u>
    A transformation that slants the shape of an object is called the shear transformation. There are two shear transformations X-Shear and Y-Shear.
    One shifts X coordinates values and other shifts Y coordinate values. However; in both the cases only one coordinate changes its coordinates and other preserves its values.
    Shearing is also termed as Skewing.<br>
    <b>X-Shear:</b>
    The X-Shear preserves the Y coordinate and changes are made to X coordinates,
    which causes the vertical lines to tilt right or left as shown in below figure.

    The transformation matrix for X-Shear can be represented as:

    <p><b>Y-Shear:</b>
        The Y-Shear preserves the X coordinates and changes the Y coordinates which causes the horizontal lines to transform into lines which slopes up or down as shown in the following figure. </p>

    The Y-Shear can be represented in matrix from as:

    <u><b>Viewing Transformation:</b></u><br>
    <p>One of the most important operations in rendering is the projection of a a three-dimensional scene onto a two-dimensional screen from an arbitrary camera position. A fundamental part of this operation is the specification of a viewing transformation, a 4×44×4 matrix that transforms a region of space into image space.</p>
   <ol type="1">
       <li>The camera coordinate system is a coordinate system with the camera at the origin, looking out over the positive z axis.</li>
       <li>It is, essentially, the scene from the camera's point of view. The raster coordinate system is the space of the pixels on the monitor.</li>
       <li>Connecting these two coordinate systems there is a special coordinate system known as the screen coordinate system.</li>
       <li>The screen coordinate system is, conceptually, the same as the film plane of a camera.</li>
       <li>It is usually best to consider both the screen coordinate system and the raster coordinate system to be two-dimensional, even though we know that RenderMan can output depth information.</li>
       <li>The RenderMan Interface Specification has a rather complex viewing transformation. The interface has many calls which each set-up a small piece of the transformation.</li>
       <li>Each of these values has a “reasonable” default, which is to say that if you don't set it, it will default to something which is probably appropriate, given the values that you have already set.</li>
       <li>The viewing transformation has lots of controls, but typically they are not all used together. Rather, a couple important controls are set and the rest are let to default to their “logical” values.</li>
       <li>The viewing transformation can be broken down into two pieces, the camera-to-screen projection and the screen-to-raster projection.</li>

   </ol>
    <ul type="circle">
        <li>The camera-to-screen projection flattens the 3-D world onto the 2-D screen.</li>
        <li>The screen-to-raster projection maps every point on the screen onto some output pixel.</li>
    </ul>
    <b>The Viewing Transformation Matrix:</b>
    <p>Given the specification of the parameters (&#945,n,f), we define a transformation that can be applied to all elements of a scene and takes the truncated viewing volume (bounded by the viewing pyramid and the planes z=-n and z=−f) to the cube -1&#8804u,v,w&#88041. This transformation is given by</p>

    <p>The transformation A&#945,n,f is commonly referred to as the viewing transformation</p>
