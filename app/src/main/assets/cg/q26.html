    <h3>Q26.Write a note on Area-Subdivision Method</h3></div>
<div class="card">
    <p>When we view a picture containing non-transparent objects and surfaces, then we cannot see those objects from view which are behind from objects closer to eye. We must remove these hidden surfaces to get a realistic screen image. The identification and removal of these surfaces is called Hidden-surface problem.
        There are two approaches for removing hidden surface problems âˆ’ Object-Space method and Image-space method. The Object-space method is implemented in physical coordinate system and image-space method is implemented in screen coordinate system.
        When we want to display a 3D object on a 2D screen, we need to identify those parts of a screen that are visible from a chosen viewing position.</p>

    <b>Area-Subdivision Method</b>
    <ul type="circle">
        <li>The area-subdivision method takes advantage by locating those view areas that represent part of a single surface.</li>
        <li>Divide the total viewing area into smaller and smaller rectangles until each small area is the projection of part of a single visible surface or no surface at all.</li>
        <li>Continue this process until the subdivisions are easily analyzed as belonging to a single surface or until they are reduced to the size of a single pixel.</li>
        <li>An easy way to do this is to successively divide the area into four equal parts at each step. There are four possible relationships that a surface can have with a specified area boundary.</li>
