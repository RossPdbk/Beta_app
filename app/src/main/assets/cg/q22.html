<div class="card">
    <p>This method is also known as counting number method. While filling an object, we often need to identify whether particular point is inside the object or outside it.
        There are two methods by which we can identify whether particular point is inside an object or outside.</p>

        <li>Even-Odd Method</li>
        <li> Nonzero winding number Method</li>

    <b>Even-Odd Method</b>
    <ul type="circle">
        <li>In this technique, we will count the edge crossing along the line from any point (x,y) to infinity.</li>
        <li>If the number of interactions is odd, then the point (x,y) is an interior point; and if the number of interactions is even, then the point (x,y) is an exterior point.</li>
        <li>The following example depicts this concept</li>
