				   <td>Flood fill colors an entire area in an enclosed figure through interconnected pixels using a single color.</td>
				   <td>Here area gets colored with pixels of a chosen color as boundary this giving the technique its name.</td>
			   </tr>
			   <tr><td>2</td>
				   <td>Sometimes we come across a figure where we want to fill the area and its boundary of the figure with different colors. We can paint such figure with a specific color instead of searching for particular boundary color as in boundary filling algorithm.</td>
				   <td>The boundary fill algorithm works as its name. This algorithm picks a point inside an figure and starts to fill until it reaches the boundary of the figure.</td>

			   </tr>
			   <tr><td>3</td>
				   <td>So, Flood Fill is one in which all connected pixels of a selected color get replaced by a fill color.</td>
				   <td>Boundary Fill is very similar with the difference being the program stopping when a given color boundary is found.</td>
			   </tr>
			   <tr><td>4</td>
				   <td>A flood fill may use an unpredictable amount of memory to finish because it isn't known how many sub-fills will be spawned.</td>
				   <td>Boundary fill is usually more complicated but it is a linear algorithm and doesn't require recursion.</td>
			   </tr>
			   <tr><td>5</td>
				   <td>Time Consuming.</td>
				   <td>It is less time Consuming.</td>
