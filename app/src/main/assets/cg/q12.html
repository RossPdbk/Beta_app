	  <p><h3>Q12.Describe the 3D representation methods?</h3>    </div>

	  <p><h4> Ans:</h4><br>
	 <b><u> B-Rep:</u></b>
<ol type="1">
<li>B-Rep stands for Boundary Representation.</li>

<li>It is an extension to the wireframe model.</li>

<li>B-Rep describes the solid in terms of its surface boundaries: Vertices, edges and faces as shown in figure</li> 
<li><img src="q12fig35.png"></li> img35

<li>It is a method for representing shapes using the limits.</li>

<li>A solid is represented as a collection of connected surface elements, the boundary between solid and non-solid.

<li>There are 2 types of information in a B – rep topological and geometric.

<li>Topological information provides the relationships among vertices, edges and faces similar to that used in a wireframe model.

<li>In addition to connectivity, topological information also includes orientation of edges and faces.

<li>Geometric information is usually equations of the edges and faces.

<li>The B-rep of 2 manifolds that have faces with holes satisfies the generalized Euler’s formula:<br>

V–E+F–H=2(C−G)<br>
V–E+F–H=2(C−G)<br></li><br></ol>
Where, V = Number of vertices.<br>

E = Number of edges.<br>

F = Number of faces.<br>

H = Number of holes in the faces.<br>

C is the number of separate components (parts).<br>

G is the genus (for a torus G = 1)<br>

<b><u>Sweep</u></b>
<ul type="circle">
<li>sweep reprentations are used to construct 3D objects from 2D shape.There are two ways to achieve sweep. </li>
<li><u>Translation Sweep</u>
In translation sweep,the 2D shape is swept along a linear path,normal to the plane of the area to construct 3D object.
To obtain the wireframe representation we have to replicate the 2D shape and draw a set of connecting lines in the direction of shape.As shown in fig.   
</li><li><img src="q12sweep.png"></li>
<li><u>Rotational Sweep</u>
In rotational sweep,the 2D shape is rotated about an axis of rotation specified in the plane od 2D shape to produce 3D objects. As shown in fig

</li></ul>

<b><u>CSG</u></b>
<ol type="1">
<li>CSG stands for Constructive Solid Geometry.</li>

<li>It is based on set of 3D solid primitives and regularized set theoretic operations.</li>

<li>Traditional primitives are: Block, cones, sphere, cylinder and torus.</li>

<li>Operations: union, intersection, difference + translation and rotation.</li>

<li>A complex solid is represented using with a binary tree usually called as CSG tree.</li>

<li>CSG tree is shown below in figure</li>
<img src="q12csg.png">
<li>CSG representation are particularly useful for capturing design intent in the form of features corresponding to material addition or removal such as bosses,holes,pockets etc</li>
<li>The CSG method uses 3D objects such as blocks,pyramids,cylinders,cones,spheresand closed spline surfaces to generate other solid objects</li>
