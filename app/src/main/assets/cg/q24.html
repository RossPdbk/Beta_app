    <h3>Q24.write short note on Koch Curve</h3></div>
<div class="card">
<b>Definition:</b><br>
    A Koch curve is a fractal curve that can be constructed by taking a straight line segment and replacing it with a pattern of multiple line segments.
    Then the line segments in that pattern are replaced by the same pattern.<br>
    <b>Construction:</b><br>
    The Koch curve can be constructed by starting with an equilateral triangle, then recursively altering each line segment as follows:

    <ul type="circle">        
        <li>Divide the line segment into three segments of equal length.</li>
        <li>Draw an equilateral triangle that has the middle segment as its base and points outward.</li>
    </ul>

    <ul type="circle">
        <li>Remove the line segment that is the base of the triangle.</li>
    </ul>
    <img src="q24i2.PNG" width="100%">
    <ul type="circle">
        <li>After one iteration of this process, the resulting shape is the outline of a hexagram.</li>
    </ul>

    <ol type="1">
        <li>The Koch snowflake is the limit approached as the above steps are followed over and over again.</li>
        <li>The Koch curve originally described by Koch is constructed with only one of the three sides of the original triangle.</li>
        <li>In other words, three Koch curves make a Koch snowflake.</li>
    </ol>
