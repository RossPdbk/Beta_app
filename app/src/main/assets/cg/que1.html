<table style border=1  rules="all" frame="box">
<tr>
<th>Sr.No.</th>
   <th>   Random Scan</th>
    <th>  Raster Scan</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>  1  . (Electron beam)</td>
<td>  Random scan operate by directing the
     electron beam to only those parts of the
     screen where the picture is to be drawn</td>
<td>           The electron beam starts at the left corner of the screen and
                  moves horizontally to the right </td> </tr>

<tr>
<td> 2 . (Use)</td>
<td>Creation of diagrams using random scan
becomes easier,so can be used in engineering and scientific drawings.</td>
<td>Raster graphics can be used in animations</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>3.  (Devices used)</td>
<td>Pen plotters and direct storage view tubes (DVST) devices are used.</td>
<td>Cathode ray tubes (CRT) are used.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>   4. (Cost)</td>
<td>The cost of device used for Random scan is much higher</td>
<td>The cost of device used for Raster scan is much cheaper.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td> 5. (Memory Requirement)</td>
<td> Requires less memory</td>
<td>Requires more memory</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>6. (Other requirements)</td>
<td>Requires Intelligent electron beam i.e process controlled</td>
<td>No such requirements</td>
