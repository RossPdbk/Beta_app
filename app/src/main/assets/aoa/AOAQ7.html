    <p><h3>Q7. Explain Krushkal's Algorithm with example.</h3></p>
</div>
<div class="card">
    <p>Kruskal's algorithm is a greedy algorithm in graph theory that finds a minimum spanning tree for a connected weighted graph.
    It finds a subset of the edges that forms a tree that includes every vertex, where the total weight of all the edges in the tree is minimized.
    This algorithm is directly based on the MST (minimum spanning tree) property.<br>
    </p>
</div>
<div class="card">
    <p>The steps for implementing Kruskal's algorithm are as follows:<br>
        <ul>
        <li>Sort all the edges from low weight to high</li><br>
        <li>Take the edge with the lowest weight and add it to the spanning tree.
            If adding the edge created a cycle, then reject this edge.</li><br>
        <li>Keep adding edges until we reach all vertices.</li><br>
        </ul>
        </p>
</div>
<div class="card">
    <p>
        Consider the following example :<br><br>
        Start by taking a pair of nodes with smallest weight.<br>
        Then select another pair with small weight but it should not form a cycle.<br>
        Continue untill all nodes are covered.<br>
