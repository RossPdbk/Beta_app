<p><h3>Q7. Explain Krushkal's Algorithm with example.</h3></p>
<hr>
<p>Kruskal's algorithm is a greedy algorithm in graph theory that finds a minimum spanning tree for a connected weighted graph. 
It finds a subset of the edges that forms a tree that includes every vertex, where the total weight of all the edges in the tree is minimized.
This algorithm is directly based on the MST( minimum spanning tree) property.<br></p>
<p>The steps for implementing Kruskal's algorithm are as follows:<br>
<ul>
<li>Sort all the edges from low weight to high</li><br>
<li>Take the edge with the lowest weight and add it to the spanning tree. If adding the edge created a cycle, then reject this edge.</li><br>
<li>Keep adding edges until we reach all vertices.</li><br>
</ul></p>
<p>
Consider the following example :<br><br>
Start by taking a pair of nodes with smallest weight.<br>
Then select another pair with small weight but it should not form a cycle.<br>
Continue untill all nodes are covered.<br>
