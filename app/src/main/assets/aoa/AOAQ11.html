        <ul>
            <li>Backtracking is an algorithmic paradigm that tries different solutions until finds a solution that “works”. </li><br>
            <li>Problems which are typically solved using backtracking technique have following property in common. </li><br>
            <li>These problems can only be solved by trying every possible configuration and each configuration is tried only once.</li><br>
            <li>This algorithm is also called as <b>m Coloring Problem</b></li><br>
            <li>Here we are given an undirected graph and 'm' colors.</li><br>
            <li>We have to determine whether the graph can be colored using at the most 'm' colors such that no two adjacent nodes
            have same colors.</li><br>

        <b>Backtracking Algorithm</b><br>
        <ul>
            <li>The idea is to assign colors one by one to different vertices, starting from the vertex 0. </li><br>
            <li>Before assigning a color, we check for safety by considering already assigned colors to the adjacent vertices. </li><br>
            <li>If we find a color assignment which is safe, we mark the color assignment as part of solution.</li><br>
            <li>If we do not a find color due to clashes then we backtrack and return false.</li>
        </ul>

<b>Algorithm:</b>
<div class="card_algo">
<pre>
1. If all colors are assigned,
2.	then print vertex assigned colors
3. Else
4. 	Trying all possible colors, assign a color to the vertex
5. 	If color assignment is possible, 
6.	  Then recursivelty assign colors to next vertices
7. 	If color assignment is not possible, 
8.	  Then de-assign color, return False
