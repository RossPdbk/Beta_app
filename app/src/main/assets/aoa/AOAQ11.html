<p><h3>Q11. Explain Graph coloring algorithm with backtracking.</h3></p>
<hr>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Backtracking is an algorithmic paradigm that tries different solutions until finds a solution that “works”. </li><br>
<li>Problems which are typically solved using backtracking technique have following property in common. </li><br>
<li>These problems can only be solved by trying every possible configuration and each configuration is tried only once.</li><br>
<li>This algorithm is also called as <b>m Coloring Problem</b></li><br>
<li>Here we are given an undirected graph and 'm' colors.</li><br>
<li>We have to determine whether the graph can be colored using at the most 'm' colors such that no two adjacent nodes
have same colors.</li><br>
</ul>

<b>Backtracking Algorithm</b><br>
<ul>
<li>The idea is to assign colors one by one to different vertices, starting from the vertex 0. </li><br>
<li>Before assigning a color, we check for safety by considering already assigned colors to the adjacent vertices. </li><br>
<li>If we find a color assignment which is safe, we mark the color assignment as part of solution.</li><br>
<li>If we do not a find color due to clashes then we backtrack and return false.</li>
