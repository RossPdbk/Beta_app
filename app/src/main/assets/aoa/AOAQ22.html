<div class="card">
The Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) problem is as follows. We are given two strings: string S of length n, and string T of length m. 
Our goal is to produce their longest common subsequence: the longest sequence of characters that appear left-to-right (but not necessarily
in a contiguous block) in both strings.
For example, consider:
S = ABAZDC
T = BACBAD
In this case, the LCS has length 4 and is the string ABAD. Another way to look at it is we are finding
a 1-1 matching between some of the letters in S and some of the letters in T such that none of the
edges in the matching cross each other.

As subproblems we will look at the LCS of a prefix of S and a prefix of T, running over all pairs of prefixes. For simplicity, let’s
worry first about finding the length of the LCS and then we can modify the algorithm to produce the actual sequence itself.
Here’s
what it looks like pictorially for the example above, with S along the leftmost column and T along
the top row.

We just fill out this matrix row by row, doing constant amount of work per entry, so this takes O(mn) time overall. 
The final answer (the length of the LCS of S and T) is in the lower-right
corner.
