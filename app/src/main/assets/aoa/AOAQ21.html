</div>
<div class="card">
    <ul>
        <li>Knuth, Morris and Pratt discovered first linear time string-matching algorithm by analysis of the naive algorithm.</li><br>
<li>It keeps the information that naive approach wasted gathered during the scan of the text. By avoiding this waste of information, it achieves a
    running time of O(m + n).</li><br>
<li>The implementation of Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm is efficient because it minimizes the total number of comparisons of the pattern against the
    input string</li>
