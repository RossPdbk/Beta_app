<p><h3>Q2. Explain three cases of master method.</h3></p>
<hr>
The Master method is a general method for solving (getting a closed form solution to) recurrence relations that arise frequently in divide and conquer algorithms, which have the following form:<br>
<h4>T(n) = aT(n/b) + f(n)</h4>
where a ≥ 1, b > 1 are constants, and f(n) is function of non-negative integer n.<br>
<p>There are three cases.<br><br>
(a) If f(n) = O(n logb a− ε ), for some ε > 0, then T(n) = Θ(n logba ).<br> <br>
(b) If f(n) = Θ(n logb a ), then T(n) = Θ(n logb a log n).<br> <br>
(c) If f(n) = Ω(n logb a+ ε ) for some ε > 0, and af(n/b) ≤ cf(n), for some c < 1 and for all n greater than some value n 0 , Then T(n) = Θ(f(n)).<br></p>
<p>Example 1 : <strong>T(n) = 4T(n/2) + n</strong><br>
For this recurrence, there are a=4, b=2, and f(n)=n. Thus n<sup>log<sub>b</sub>a</sup> is n<sup>2</sup>, and f(n) is O(n<sup>2-ε</sup>) for ε=1, and Case 1 applies. Thus T(n) is Θ(n<sup>2</sup>).<br></p>
<p>Example 2 : <strong>(n) = 4T(n/2) + n<sup>2</sup></strong><br>
For this recurrence, there are again a=4, b=2, but now f(n)=n<sup>2</sup>. Again n<sup>log<sub>b</sub>a</sup> is n<sup>2</sup>, and f(n) is thus Θ(n<sup>2</sup>), so Case 2 applies. Thus T(n) is Θ(n<sup>2</sup> log n).<br></p>
<p>Example 3 : <strong>T(n) = 4T(n/2) + n<sup>3</sup></strong><br>
For this recurrence, there are again a=4, b=2, but now f(n)=n<sup>3</sup>. Again n<sup>log<sub>b</sub>a</sup> is n<sup>2</sup>, and f(n) is thus Ω(n<sup>2+ε</sup>) for ε=1. Moreover, 4(n/2)3 ≤ kn3 for k=1/2, so Case 3 applies. Thus T(n) is Θ(n<sup>3</sup>).</p>
