<b>Algorithm:</b><br>
Let, S is a set of elements and m is the expected sum of subsets. Then:
<ol type="number">
<li>Start with an empty set.</li><br>
<li>Add to the subset, the next element from the list.</li><br>
<li>If the subset is having sum m then stop with that subset as solution.</li><br>
<li>If the subset is not feasible or if we have reached the end of the set then backtrack through the subset until we find the most suitable value.</li><br>
<li>If the subset is feasible then repeat step 2.</li><br>
<li>If we have visited all the elements without finding a suitable subset and if no backtracking is possible then stop without solution.</li>
</ol>
