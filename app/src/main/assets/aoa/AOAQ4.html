<p><h3>Q4. Explain 0/1 Knapsack problem </h3></p>
<hr>
<p>Ans:<br>
<p>
	The only difference between Knapsack and 0/1 Knapsack is that in 0/1 Knapsack we do not take fractional part of the item.<br>
	Either the item is taken as a whole or else it is not taken.
	<ul>
		<li>We are given 'n' number of objects and a knapsack ( bag ). Each object has differect weight and cost.</li> <br>
		<li>The knapsack or bag has the capacity of 'm'. That is the bag can hold total weight of 'm'.</li><br>
		<li>Our job is to fill the bag with those objects. But while doing so we should make sure that the total cost 
			of all the objects must be as high as possible. </li><br>
		<li>The objective is to maximise the total profit earned</li><br>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Example</strong><br>
	Let us consider that the capacity of the knapsack W = 60 and the list of provided items are shown in the following table âˆ’<br>
	<table border = "1" cellpadding="0px" cellspacing="0px" >
         <tr>
            <td width="60px"><center>Item</center></td>
            <td width="60px"><center>Profit</center></td>
			<td width="60px"><center>Weight</center></td>
         </tr>
			
         <tr>
            <td>A</td>
            <td>280</td>
			<td>40</td>
         </tr>
		 
		 <tr>
            <td>B</td>
            <td>100</td>
			<td>10</td>
         </tr>
		 
		 <tr>
            <td>C</td>
            <td>120</td>
			<td>20</td>
         </tr>
		 
		 <tr>
            <td>D</td>
            <td>120</td>
			<td>24</td>
         </tr>	 
    </table>
</p>
<p>	
	<strong>Step 1 :</strong> First we will add a column which will have the ratio of profit/weight<br>
	<table border = "1" cellpadding="0px" cellspacing="0px" >
         <tr>
            <td width="60px"><center>Item</center></td>
            <td width="60px"><center>Profit</center></td>
			<td width="60px"><center>Weight</center></td>
			<td width="60px"><center>Ratio(Profit/Weight)</center></td>
         </tr>
			
         <tr>
            <td>A</td>
            <td>280</td>
			<td>40</td>
			<td>7</td
         </tr>
		 
		 <tr>
            <td>B</td>
            <td>100</td>
			<td>10</td>
			<td>10</td
         </tr>
		 
		 <tr>
            <td>C</td>
            <td>120</td>
			<td>20</td>
			<td>6</td
         </tr>
		 
		 <tr>
            <td>D</td>
            <td>120</td>
			<td>24</td>
			<td>5</td
         </tr>	 
    </table>
</p>	
<p>
	<Strong>Step 2 :</Strong> Sort the table in decreasing order of Ratio. 
	<table border = "1" cellpadding="0px" cellspacing="0px" >
         <tr>
            <td width="60px"><center>Item</center></td>
            <td width="60px"><center>Profit</center></td>
			<td width="60px"><center>Weight</center></td>
			<td width="60px"><center>Ratio(Profit/Weight)</center></td>
         </tr>
			
		<tr>
            <td>B</td>
            <td>100</td>
			<td>10</td>
			<td>10</td
         </tr>
         <tr>
            <td>A</td>
            <td>280</td>
			<td>40</td>
			<td>7</td
         </tr>
		  
		 <tr>
            <td>C</td>
            <td>120</td>
			<td>20</td>
			<td>6</td
         </tr>
		 
		 <tr>
            <td>D</td>
            <td>120</td>
			<td>24</td>
			<td>5</td
         </tr>	 
    </table>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Step 3 :</strong> Now start adding the items in the bag strating with item having highest ratio.<br><br>
	Weight avaible=60 and Profit=0<br><br>
	Add item B , Weight avaible = 60 - 10 = 50 Profit=100<br><br>
	Add item A , Weight avaible = 50 - 40 = 10 Profit=100 + 280 = 380<br><br>
	Now, C is chosen as the next item. However, the whole item cannot be chosen as the remaining capacity of the knapsack is less than the weight of C.<br><br>
	Thus item C is rejected.<br><br>		
	Now, D is chosen as the next item. Even here the remaining capacity of the knapsack is less than the weight of D.<br><br>
	Thus D is also rejected.<br><br>
	Total Profit = 380<br>
	This is the optimal solution. We cannot gain more profit selecting any different combination of items.<br>
