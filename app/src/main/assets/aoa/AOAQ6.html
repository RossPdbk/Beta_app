<p><h3>Q6. Explain Prim's Algorithm with example.</h3></p>
</div>
<div class="card">
<p>Prim's algorithm is a greedy algorithm that finds a minimum spanning tree for a connected weighted undirected graph.
It finds a subset of the edges that forms a tree that includes every vertex, where the total weight of all the edges in the tree is minimized.
This algorithm is directly based on the MST( minimum spanning tree) property.<br></p>
</div>
<div class="card">
<p>The following are the main 3 steps of the Prim's Algorithm:<br>
<ul>
<li>Begin with any vertex which you think would be suitable and add it to the tree.</li><br>
<li>Find an edge that connects any vertex in the tree to any vertex that is not in the tree. Note that, we don't have to form cycles.</li><br>
<li>Stop when n - 1 edges have been added to the tree.</li><br>
</ul>
    </p>

    <p>
Consider the following example :<br>
Start from the node 1 and then select the node with minimum distance.<br>
Continue the procedure until all nodes are covered.<br>
