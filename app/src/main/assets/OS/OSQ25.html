			<tr>
				<td>1.</td>
				<td>In deadlock prevention, We ensure that any of four necessary conditions dows not occur.</td>
				<td>In deadlock avoidance, System needs additional information about how resources are to be requested and by knowing we try to avoid deadlock condition.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>2.</td>
				<td>It does not need knowledge of future resource request.</td>
				<td>It requires all knowledge of all resource request at the beginning itself.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>3.</td>
				<td>Device utilization is low and throughput is reduced.</td>
				<td>device utilization is high and throughput is increased as compared to prevention.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>4.</td>
				<td>Major drawback is degradation of system efficiency.</td>
				<td>Major drawback is that it is difficult to have information of all resources needed at very first stage of process.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>5.</td>
				<td>It includes non-blocking synchro algorithm, dijkstra algorithm, serializing tokens etc.</td>
				<td>For single instance of resource type --> Resouce allocation graph &amp; For multiple instance type --> Banker's algorithm.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>6.</td>
				<td>Preemtion happens.</td>
				<td>No preemption.</td>
