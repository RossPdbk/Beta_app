		<p>
		The   following   are   the   6   high   level   stages   of   a   typical   Linux   boot   process.  <br><br>

	<div class="card">
	<p>	
		<b>1.   BIOS </b><br>
   			<ul>
   			<li>BIOS   stands   for   Basic   Input/Output   System Performs   some   system   integrity   checks, Searches, loads,   and   executes   the   boot   loader   program.
   			<li>It   looks   for   boot   loader   in   floppy,   cd-rom,   or hard   drive.
   			<li>You   can   press   a   key   (typically   F12   of   F2,   but   it   depends   on   your   system)   during the   BIOS   startup   to   change   the   boot   sequence.
 			<li>Once   the   boot   loader   program   is   detected and   loaded   into   the   memory,   BIOS   gives   the   control   to   it.
 			<li>So,   in   simple   terms   BIOS   loads   and executes   the   MBR  boot   loader.
  			 </ul>
  			</p>
  	</div>

  	<div class="card">	<p>	 
		<b>2.   MBR </b><br>
			<ul>
   			<li>MBR   stands   for   Master   Boot   Record.
   			<li>It   is   located   in   the   1st   sector   of   the   bootable   disk, Typically   /dev/hda,   or   /dev/sda   MBR   is   less   than   512   bytes   in   size.
   			<li>This   has   three components   :
    			<ul>
				<li>1)   primary   boot   loader   info   in   1st   446   bytes
				<li>2)   partition   table   info   in   next   64   bytes
				<li>3)   mbr   validation   check   in   last   2   bytes.
				<li>It   contains   information   about   GRUB   (or   LILO   in   old systems).
				</ul>
			<li>So,   in   simple   terms   MBR   loads   and   executes   the   GRUB   boot   loader.
	 		</ul>
	 </p></div>

	<div class="card"><p>
		<b>3.   GRUB  </b> <br>
			<ul>
			<li>GRUB   stands   for   Grand   Unified   Bootloader.
  			<li>If   you   have   multiple   kernel   images   installed   on your   system,   you   can   choose   which   one   to   be   executed.
  			<li>GRUB   displays   a   splash   screen, waits   for   few   seconds,   if   you   don't   enter   anything,   it   loads   the   default   kernel   image   as specified   in   the   grub   configuration   file.
  			<li>GRUB   has   the   knowledge   of   the   filesystem   (the   older Linux   loader   LILO   didn't   understand   filesystem).
   			<li>Grub   configuration   file   is /boot/grub/grub.conf   (/etc/grub.conf   is   a  link   to   this).
   			<li>So,   in   simple   terms GRUB   just   loads   and   executes   Kernel   and   initrd   images.
			</ul>
	</p></div>

	<div class="card"><p>
		<b>4.   Kernel </b><br>
   			<ul>
   			<li>Mounts   the   root   file   system   as   specified   in   the   "root="   in   grub.conf
   			<li>Kernel   executes   the /sbin/init   program
   			<li>Since   init   was   the   1st   program   to   be   executed   by   Linux   Kernel,   it   has   the process   id   (PID)   of   1.
   			<li>Do   a   'ps   -ef   |   grep   init'   and   check   the   pid.initrd   stands   for   Initial   RAM Disk.
   			<li>initrd   is   used   by   kernel   as   temporary   root   file   system   until   kernel   is   booted   and   the   real root   file   system   is   mounted.
   			<li>It   also   contains   necessary   drivers   compiled   inside,  which   helps   it to   access   the   hard   drive   partitions,   and   other   hardware.
  			</ul>
  	</p></div>
  
  	<div class="card"><p>
		<b>5.   Init </b> <br>
   			<ul>
			<li>Looks   at   the   /etc/inittab   file   to   decide   the   Linux   run   level.
			<li>Init   identifies   the   default   initlevel   from   /etc/inittab   and   uses   that   to load   all   appropriate   program.
			<li>Execute   â€˜grep   initdefault   /etc/inittab'   on   your   system   to   identify the   default   run   levelIf   you   want   to   get   into   trouble,   you   can   set   the   default   run   level   to   0   or   6.
			<li>Since   you   know   what   0   and   6   means,   probably   you   might   not   do   that.
			<li>Typically   you   would   set the   default   run   level   to   either   3   or   5.
			</ul>
	</p></div>
 
 	<div class="card"><p>
		<b>6.   Runlevel   programs </b><br>
   			<ul>
			<li>When   the   Linux   system   is   booting   up,   you   might   see   various   services   getting   started.
			<li>For example,   it   might   say   "starting   sendmail   ...  OK".
			<li>Those   are   the   runlevel   programs,   executed from   the   run   level   directory   as   defined   by   your   run  level.
			<li>Depending   on   your   default   init   level setting,   the   system   will   execute   the   programs   from   one   of   the   following   directories :
				<ul>
					<li>Run   level 0   -   /etc/rc.d/rc0.d/
					<li>Run  level   1   -   /etc/rc.d/rc1.d/
					<li>Run   level   2   -   /etc/rc.d/rc2.d/
					<li>Run   level   3   - /etc/rc.d/rc3.d/
					<li>Run   level   4   -   /etc/rc.d/rc4.d/
					<li>Run   level   5   -   /etc/rc.d/rc5.d/
					<li>Run   level   6   - /etc/rc.d/rc6.d/
	 			</ul>
	 		</ul>
