		<h4>Q15. Explain solution for readers/writers problem using semaphores. </h4>
	</div>

    <div class="card">
		<p>Readers   writer   problem   is   another   example   of   a   classic   synchronization   problem.
        There   are many   variants   of   this   problem,   one   of   which   is   examined   below.</p>

        <b>- Problem   Statement : </b><br>
        <p>There   is   a   shared   resource   which   should   be   accessed   by   multiple   processes.
        There   are   two types   of   processes   in   this   context.   They   are   reader   and   writer.
        Any   number   of   readers   can read   from   the   shared   resource   simultaneously,   but   only  one   writer   can   write   to   the   shared resource.
        When   a   writer   is   writing   data   to   the   resource,   no   other   process   can   access   the resource.
        A   writer   cannot   write   to  the   resource   if   there   are   non   zero   number   of   readers accessing   the   resource. </p>

        <b>- Solution : </b><br>
        <p>From   the   above   problem   statement,   it   is   evident   that   readers   have   higher   priority   than   writer.
        If   a   writer   wants   to   write   to   the   resource,   it   must   wait   until   there   are   no   readers   currently accessing   that   resource.
        Here,   we   use   one   mutex   m   and   a   semaphore   w.
        An   integer   variable   read_count   is   used   to maintain   the   number   of   readers   currently   accessing   the   resource.
        The   variable   read_count   is initialized   to   0.
        A   value   of   1   is   given   initially   to   m   and   w.
        Instead   of   having   the   process   to   acquire   lock   on   the   shared   resource,   we   use   the   mutex   m   to make   the   process   to   acquire   and   release   lock   whenever   it   is   updating   the   read_count variable.  </p>

         <b> - Code   Explained : </b> <br>
        <p>
        <ul>
		    <li>As   seen   above   in   the   code   for   the   writer,   the   writer   just   waits   on   the   w   semaphore   until   it gets   a   chance   to   write   to   the   resource.
		    <li>After   performing   the   write   operation,   it   increments   w   so   that   the   next   writer   can   access   the resource.
		    <li>On   the   other   hand,   in   the   code   for   the   reader,   the   lock   is   acquired   whenever   the   read_count is   updated   by   a   process.
		    <li>When   a   reader   wants   to   access   the   resource,   first   it   increments   the   read_count   value,   then accesses   the   resource   and   then   decrements   the   read_count   value.
		    <li>The   semaphore   w   is   used   by   the   first   reader   which   enters   the   critical   section   and   the   last reader   which   exits   the   critical   section.
		    <li>The   reason   for   this   is,   when   the   first   readers   enters   the   critical   section,   the   writer   is   blocked from   the   resource.
		    <li>Only   new   readers   can   access   the   resource   now.
	    	<li>Similarly,   when   the   last   reader   exits   the   critical   section,   it   signals   the   writer   using   the   w semaphore   because   there   are   zero   readers   now   and   a   writer   can   have   the   chance   to   access the   resource.
         </ul>
         </p>
