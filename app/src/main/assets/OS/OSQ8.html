		<ul>
	
		<li>
			A demand paging is paging system with swapping where pages are brought in main memory from secondary storage on demand.
			When it is needed to execute a process, memory manager swap it into memory.
		</li><br>
	
		<li>
			Instead of swapping entire process on memory, demand paging allows to swap in only those pages which are required for execution at that time. If a page is not currently mapped
			to a frame, The access fails and generate a page fault. this is special type of interrupt.
		</li><br>
	
		<li>
			The operating system handler for this interrupt initiates a disk operation to read a desirted page, and maaps it to a free fraame. while thgis is being
			done, Process is blocked.
		</li><br>
	
		<li>
			When the page becomes available, The process is unblocked and placed in ready queue. when it is scheduled, It will resume it's
			execution with the instruction that caused the page fault. but this time it will work. This manner of getting pages as they are needed
			is called demand paging.</li><br>

		<li>
			when the process is to be swapped in, The pager program checks which process will be used before the process swapped out again.
		</li><br>
	
		<li>
			Instead of swapping in whole process, The pager bring only those necessary pages into memory. this avoids swapping
			in those pages into memory which are not required.
		</li><br>

		<li>
			it saves swap time and the amount of physical memory needeed.
		</li><br>
	
		<li>
			In demand paging, valid and invalid bits are used to differentiate between those pages that are in memory and those pages
			that are on the disk.
		</li><br>
	
		<li>
			Demand paging keep more processes in memory than the sum of their memory needs ensuring CPU utilization as high as possible.
		</li>
