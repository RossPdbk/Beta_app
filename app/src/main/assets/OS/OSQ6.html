		<h4>Q6. Explain Banker's algorithm in details.</h4>
	</div>

	<div class="card">
		<p>The banker's algorithm is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm that tests for safety
		by simulating the allocation for predetermined maximum possible amounts of all resources,
		then makes an 'state' check to test for possible activities, before deciding whether allocation should be allowed to continue.</p>
		Following Data structures are used to implement the Banker's Algorithm :<br><br>
		Let 'n' be the number of processes in the system and 'm' be the number of resources types.<br><br>
	
		1. Available :
			<ul>
			<li>It is a 1-d array of size 'm' indicating the number of available resources of each type.</li>
			<li>Available[ j ] = k means there are 'k' instances of resource type R<sub>j</sub>.</li>
			</ul>

		2. Max :
			<ul>
			<li>It is a 2-d array of size 'n*m' that defines the maximum demand of each process in a system.</li>
			<li>Max[ i, j ] = k means process Pimay request at most 'k' instances of resource type R<sub>j</sub>.</li>
			</ul>

		3. Allocation :
			<ul>
			<li>It is a 2-d array of size 'n*m' that defines the number of resources of each type currently allocated to each process.</li>
			<li>Allocation[ i, j ] = k means process Pi is currently allocated 'k' instances of resource type Rj.</li>
			</ul>
	
	
		4. Need :
			<ul>
			<li>It is a 2-d array of size 'n*m' that indicates the remaining resource need of each process.</li>
			<li>Need [ i,  j ] = k means process Picurrently allocated 'k' instances of resource type Rj.</li>
			<li>Need [ i,  j ] = Max [ i,  j ] - Allocation [ i,  j ]. </li>
			</ul><br>
	
		Allocation<sub>i</sub> specifies the resources currently allocated to process P<sub>i</sub> and Need<sub>i</sub> specifies the additional resources that process P<sub>i</sub> may still request to complete its task.<br><br>

		<b>Banker's algorithm consist of Safety algorithm and Resource request algorithm.</b><br><br>

		<b>A. Safety algorithm : </b><br><br>
	
		The algorithm to find out whether or not the system is in safe mode.<br><br>

		<i>
		Let Work and Finish be vectors of length 'm' and 'n' respectively.<br>
			<ol>
			<li>Initialize : Work = Available; <br>
			Finish[i] = false; for i=1,2,3,......,n</li><br>

			<li>Finish an i such that both :<br>
			i. Finish[i]=false;<br>
			ii. Need<sub>i</sub> <= Work<br>
			If no such i exist go to step 4.</li><br>
	
			<li>Work = Work + Allocation<sub>i</sub><br>
			Finish[i] = true;
			<br>Go to Step 2.</li><br>
	
			<li>If Finish[i] = true for all i,<br>
			then the system is in safe state.</li>

	<div class="card">
		<br>
		<b>B Resource request algorithm : </b><br><br>
	
		<i>
			Let Request<sub>i</sub> be the request array for process P<sub>i</sub>.
			Request<sub>i</sub>[j] = k means process Pi wants k instances of resource type R<sub>j</sub>.
			When a request for resources is made by process P<sub>i</sub>,
			the following actions are taken: <br><br>
	
			<ol>
	
			<li>If Request<sub>i</sub> <= Need<sub>i</sub><br>
				Go to step 2. Otherwise, Raise an error condition since process has exceeded its maximum claim.
			</li><br>

			<li>If Request<sub>i</sub> <= Available<br>
				Go to step 2.<br>
				Otherwise P<sub>i</sub> must wait since resources are not available.
			</li><br>
	
			<li>
				Have the system pretend to have allocated the requested resources to Process Pi by modifying the state
				follows : <br>
				Available = Available - Request<sub>i</sub>;
				<br>Allocation<sub>i</sub> = Allocation<sub>i</sub> + Request<sub>i</sub>;
				<br>Need<sub>i</sub> = Need<sub>i</sub> - request<sub>i</sub> ;
			</li>
