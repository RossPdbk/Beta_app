<h3>Q. Explain process state transition in UNIX OS.</h3>

<img src="Process_state_transition.jpg" width=100%> <br>

<p>The lifetime of a process can be divided into a set of states. The following list describe the complete set of process states. </p>

<ol>
    <li>The process is executing in user mode. </li><br>

    <li>The process is executing is kernel mode. </li><br>

    <li>The process is not executing but is ready to run as soon as the kernel schedules it. </li><br>

    <li>The process is sleeping and resides in main memory. </li><br>

    <li>The process is ready to run, but the swapper must swap the process into main memory before the kernel can schedule it to execute. </li><br>

    <li>The process is sleeping and the swapper has swapped the process to secondary storage to make room for other processes in main memory. </li><br>

    <li>The process is returning from the kernel to user mode,
        but the kernel preempts it and does a context switch to schedule another process.
        The distinction between this state and state 3 will be brought out shortly. </li><br>

    <li>The process is newly created and is in a transition state the process exists,
        but it is not ready to run nor is it sleeping. This state is the start state for all processes except process 0. </li><br>

    <li>The process executed the exit system call and is in the zombie state.
        The process no longer exists, but it leaves a record containing an exit code and some timing statistics for its parent process to collect.
        The zombie state is the final state of a process.</li><br>
