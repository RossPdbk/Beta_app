			Q21. Protection Mechanism

			<ul>
				<li>Memory protection in a paged environment is accomplished by protection bits associated with each frame.</li><br>

				<li>Suppose we have read-only file. Every reference to the memory goes through page table to find correct frame.</li><br>

				<li>At the same time, Physical address is being computed. The protection bit can be checked to verify that no-write are being made.</li><br>

				<li>For this finer level protection, we can create a hardware to provide read-only, read-write or execute only protection by providing seperate protection bits.</li><br>

				<li>This bit is valid/invalid bit. When bit is set to 'Valid', Page is legal and address space is sent and if bit is set to 'Invalid' then page is not allowed.</li><br>

				<li>E.g. The system with 14 bit address space (0-16383), But we have a program that has address only from 0 to 10468. so address in page 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 are mapped normally as they have valid bit but page 6 & 7 are not allowed as they are attached with invalid bit.</li>
