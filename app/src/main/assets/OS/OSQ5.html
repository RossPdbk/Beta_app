		<h4>Q5. Explain Critical section problem.</h4>
	</div>

	<div class="card">
		<p>A Critical Section is a code segment that accesses shared variables and has to be executed as an atomic action.
		It means that in a group of cooperating processes, at a given point of time, only one process must be executing its critical section.
		If any other process also wants to execute its critical section, it must wait until the first one finishes.

		<p><b>Solution to Critical Section Problem A solution to the critical section problem must satisfy the following three conditions : </b></p><br>
		<ol>
		
		<li><u>Mutual Exclusion </u><br>
		Out of a group of cooperating processes, only one process can be in its critical section 
		at a given point of time. </li><br>

		<li><u>Progress </u><br>
		If no process is in its critical section, and if one or more threads want to execute their 
		critical section then any one of these threads must be allowed to get into its critical 
		section. </li><br>

		<li><u>Bounded Waiting </u><br>
		After a process makes a request for getting into its critical section, there is a limit for 
		how many other processes can get into their critical section, before this process's 
		request is granted. So after the limit is reached, system must grant the process 
		permission to get into its critical section. </li>
