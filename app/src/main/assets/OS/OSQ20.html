			Q20. Explain hardware support for paging.
		</h4>
		</div>

		<div class="card">
		<p>
			<ul>
				<li>The hardware implementation of page table can be done in several ways. In simplest case, Page table is implemented as set of dedicated registers. But the problem with this approach is the time required to access a user memory location. This problem is overcome by TLB.</li><br>

				<li>The translation look-aside buffer is a special, small, fast look-up, hardware cache.</li><br>

				<li>The TLB is associative, high speed memory.</li><br>

				<li>Each entry in TLb has two parts : 1. Key (tag), 2. Value</li><br>

				<li>When associative memory is present with an item, The item is compared with all keys simultaneously. If item is found corresponding value field is return.</li><br>

				<li>The search is fast but hardware is expensive.</li><br>

				<li>The number of entries in TLB is small often numbering between 64 to 1024.</li><br>

				<li>The TLB is usedwith the page table in the following way :
					<ol>
						<li>The TLB contains only few of page table entries when logical address is generated by CPU. Its page number is represented to TLB.</li>
						<li>If page number is found, Its frame number is immidiately available and ready to access memory</li>
						<li>If page number is not found in TLB, A memory reference to the page table must be made where frame number is obtained and is ready to access memory.</li>
					</ol>
				</li><br>

				<li>The percentage of times that a particular page number is found in the TLB is called as Hit ratio.</li><br>

				<li>Effective access time = (t+E)a+(2t+E)(1-a) = (2-a)t+E
					<br>
					Here, a = hit ratio, E = assciative look-up
				</li>
