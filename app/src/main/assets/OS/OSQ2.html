		<b>Q. What are various services provided by OS?</b><hr>
		
		<p> An   operating   system   provides   services   to   programs   and   to   the   users   of   those   programs.   It provides   an   environment   for   the   execution   of   programs.   The   services  provided   by   one operating   system   is   different   than   other   operating   system.  Operating   system   makes   the   programming   task   easier. </p><br>
 
		<b>The   common   services   provided   by the   operating   system   is   listed   below.  </b></br></br>
 
		<ol>
		
		<li>Program execution : <br>
		Operating   system   loads   a   program   into   memory   and   executes   the program. 
		The   program   must   be   able   to   end   its   execution,   either   normally   or   abnormally. </li><br>
 
		<li>I/O operation : <br>
			I/O   means   any   file   or   any   specific   I/O   device. 
			Program   may   require   any   I/O device   while   running. 
			So   operating   system   must   provide   the   required   I/O.</li> <br>
 
		<li>File system manipulation :<br> 
		Program   needs   to   read   a   file   or   write   a   file. 
			The   operating   system gives   the   permission   to   the   program   for   operation   on   file. </li><br>
			
		<li> Communication : <br> Data   transfer   between   two   processes   is   required   for   some   lime.
			The   both processes   are   on   the   one   computer   or   on   different   computer   but   connected   through computer   network   Communication   may   be   implemented   by   two   methods:   shared   memory and   message   passing. </li><br>

 
		<li>Error detection :<br>
		Error   may   occur   in   CPU,   in   I/O   device   or   in   the   memory   hardware.
		The operating   system   constantly   needs   to   be   aware   of   possible   errors. 
		It   should   take   the appropriate   action   to   ensure   correct   and   consistent   computing. </li><br>
		
		
		<li> Operating   system   with   multiple   users   provide   following   services :
			<ul>
				<li> Resource allocation
				<li> Accounting
				<li> Protection
			</ul>
			</li><br>
