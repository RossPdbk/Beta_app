	<h4>Explain different pipelining Hazards.</h4>

	<div class="card">
	<p>
	<ol>
	<li>There are situations, called hazards, that prevent the next instruction in the instruction stream from being executing during its designated clock cycle.</li>
	<li>Hazards reduce the performance from the ideal speedup gained by pipelining.</li>
	<li>There are three classes of hazards: </li>
	<ul>
	<li><b>Structural Hazards</b> </li>
	<li><b>Data Hazards</b> </li>
	<li><b>Control Hazards</b></li>
	</ul>
	<li><b>Structural Hazards :</b> They arise from resource conflicts when the hardware cannot support all possible combinations of instructions in simultaneous overlapped execution.<br>
							The most common case is when memory is accessed at the same time by two instructions. One instruction may need to access the memory as part of the 
							Execute or Write back phase while other instruction is being fetched. In this case if both the instructions and data reside in the same memory. 
							Both the instructions can't proceed together and one of them needs to be stalled till the other is done with the memory access part. 
							Thus in general sufficient hardware resources are needed for avoiding structural hazards.</li>
	<li><b>Data Hazards: </b>They arise when an instruction depends on the result of a previous instruction i.e when operands of first instruction is needed in second intruction.<br>
			Whenever there are two instructions one of which depends on the data obtained from the other.<br>
			A=A+A+5;<br>
			B=A+1;<br>
			For the above sequence, the second instruction needs the value of 'A' computed in the first instruction.<br>
			Thus the second instruction is said to depend on the first.</li>
	<li><b>Control Hazards :</b>They arise from the pipelining of branches and other instructions that change the PC.<br>
	However the problem arises when one of the instructions is a branching instruction to some other memory location.
	Thus all the instruction fetched in the pipeline from consecutive memory locations are invalid now and need to removed.<br>
